JSONParser---C--Unity3D
=======================

A general purpose C#/Unity3D JSON parser.  I wasn't a fan of how other JSON parser worked in C# and specifically in Unity3D, so I rolled my own.  You can easily load an external JSON file and get back a dictionary object that contains JSONObjects.  Fast and easy to use.
